This is a webpage I created from a Vercel template, and adjusted to my needs for a personal website.

## Notes

## Accesibility
Modified cards in Cinematography Page so that it is more accesible for screen readers. Instead of each card being ona huge clickable link, I made the title clickable, so that a screen reader allows to go through the projects by name. Then, I extended the clickable area to the whole container using a span element.

## Rounded cards

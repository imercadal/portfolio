                        My <Link href='/directing' className="font-bold">films</Link> explore a variety of topics, 
                        including environmentalism, power dynamics and social justice, and I&apos;m particularly interested

                        My debut feature film <Link href='/directing/aguas-y-restos' className="font-bold">Aguas y restos</Link> is in development 
                        and is currently part of the <a href="https://www.torinofilmlab.it/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Torino Film Lab&apos;s</a> Green Narratives 
                        development workshop. My short film Baby Steps was just finished and will premiere soon. And although I specialize in film, I also 
                        work with mixed media, I am a full stack developer, and collaborate with digital artists, theater makers and performers, particularly 
                        within the company I&apos;m a part of, <a href="https://glitchworks.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="font-bold"> Glitch</a>.

                    <p>
                        I grew up in Talca, Chile, and  I&apos;ve been living in NYC for the past seven years. In that period, I&apos;ve graduated with a Film MFA 
                        from NYU Tisch and I&apos;ve been Director of Photography on numerous short narrative films. My work is shaped by my bachelor degree 
                        in film aesthetics, and my previous work in documentary film back in Chile.

                        Besides dedicating some time to my projects as writer/director, I&apos;m interested in collaborating with other people, 
                        whether as a DP or in any capacity that will allow me to explore, grow and learn. So if my work looks like down your alley, hit me up!
